 * opening two chats and closing the second, and what they did last has to win.

 * which kind it is: one the user made some other way (a typed address, a link,
 * Back), one the dock made that a newer one has since replaced, or the newest one
 * the dock made. Only the newest acts. An older one is out of date, and one for a
