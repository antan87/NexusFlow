/**
 * @module core/progression-policy
 * One decision for "may this workspace be finished?", shared by the CLI, the
 * GUI server and MCP so the same tested content always gets the same answer.
 *
 * Evidence is the latest verification of each editable repository, bound to
 * the content that was tested (HEAD plus a fingerprint of the working tree).
 * Missing, failed, timed-out, unreadable and stale evidence all block. A
 * caller may still proceed with an explicit override that states a reason;
 * the override is recorded and returned, never implied by a generic "yes".
 * Checkpoint commits are not gated by this policy — only finish/release is.
