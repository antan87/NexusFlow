# Team Strategy: Plan, Implement, Review

Deliver one cohesive change through a bounded plan, implementation, and review.

1. Read the current assignment and relevant approved sources. Resolve important
   unknowns and define observable acceptance criteria in the existing milestone
   plan. In ContextSpace, edit the lifecycle source through the Plan editor;
   `contextspace-plan.md` is its generated view. Do not create a second plan.
2. If the assignment is investigation or design, return that stage's output and
   stop. Proceed to implementation only when the current user authorization covers it.
3. Implement the assigned outcome and test relevant behavior, including concrete
   failure and recovery paths. Preserve compatibility with existing consumers.
4. Review correctness, scope, usability where relevant, and verification evidence.
   Fix in-scope findings, rerun affected checks, and report remaining limitations.

One developer or agent can perform this loop. Use independent review or bounded
parallel work when available, authorized, and useful; a fixed agent topology is
not required. Reuse the same sources and milestone state across handoffs.
Read the current PR head and checks before declaring merge readiness.
